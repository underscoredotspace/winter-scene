# Winter Scene

It's a dark winter evening, SVG stars are twinkling and snow is falling gently onto the some rather chaotic looking pine trees. The [crescent|half|full] moon shines brightly. 

Maybe in the future, someone will build some houses and there will be children making a snowman and throwing snowballs at each other. Who knows? 

Made possible with ReactJS and CSS3.
