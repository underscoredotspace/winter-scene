# Winter Scene
It's a dark winter night, SVG stars are twinkling, and snow is falling gently onto (or at least in the vicinity of) some rather interesting looking pine trees. 

Made possible with ReactJS, HTML5 canvas (snow), SVG (stars and trees) and CSS3 (star animation is 100% CSS).


### How's it made? 

If you'd like to learn more, I'm working on a series of blog posts detailing how each part is made up, starting with the SVG stars. I'll post links on Twitter [@_dotSpace](https://twitter.com/_dotSpace) ~~once I fix my blog~~ - [blog](https://underscore.space) fixed! Posts coming very soon. 


### Compatability
I know it runs with Chrome 60, Safari 10.1 and Firefox 57 (cos those are the oldest browsers I currently have access to), but it will almost certainly run on any modern browser cos it's Babeled. 

Loads on IE11, but without snowfall. I'm sure the Babel translate could be made to sort this, but how much to I care about IE? 

Looks odd on mobile, so there's a mobile version (yeah, I know) at `/#mobile` 


### Improvements
I'd like to have a moon (with some proper looking cycle) and maybe some clouds. Also, performance could be a better. Could the canvas stuff be in a web worker so it's off the main thread?
